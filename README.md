# UFO Sightings Data Exploration

## Introduction

Welcome to this informal exploration of UFO sightings data! Recently I completed the Data Science and Machine Learning career path at Codecademy, during this course I tackled in-depth data explorations and developed a robust analytical skill set. This project, however, deviates from these sorts of analyses to venture into the UFO sightings just for the fun and fascination of it. I have sat down on this Friday afternoon and plan on conducting this light-hearted analysis just for the enjoyment of it.

With a First Class Mathematics degree that emphasized statistics and modeling, I've spent much of my academic and professional life delving into datasets, uncovering patterns, and deriving insights. While my actuarial role and mathematics degree somewhat limited what data I could use I have found an outlet in my own time by making use of publicly available data.

This dataset caught my eye, so I decided I would spend an afternoon exploring it. Are there discernible patterns that lend credibility to UFO sightings? Do certain geographical regions report consistent UFO shapes?

## Project Goals

- **Engage in Fun Exploration**: Tackle a dataset that breaks away from the norm and fuels intrigue.
- **Showcase Analytical Prowess**: Leverage this analysis to highlight my skills in data wrangling, statistical reasoning, and compelling data visualization.
- **Advance Learning and Growth**: Continue to refine my proficiency in Python and its powerful data libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and seaborn. These tools are indispensable to data professionals and are becoming increasingly relevant in software development.

## Getting Involved

If you're curious about UFO sightings or data analysis, feel free to dive into the code, explore the data, and perhaps contribute your own analyses or visualizations.
